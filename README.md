Text bot for Harvard students to get shuttle updates without having to use Passio Go!

Computational subtask involves scrapping http://shuttle.harvard.edu/ to get live shuttle updates that can be sent via a text bot. Desired functionality is allowing users to text the bot a shuttle stop e.g. "quad" and recieve a text listing the next shuttles arriving at that stop.
